## Bitter Lessons in Agentic AI
### A Builder's Journey from the Trenches

Hard-won lessons from building production agentic AI systems. This blog shares practical insights on tool use, multi-step reasoning, error recovery, and architectural patterns for autonomous AI agents. Topics span prompt engineering, system design, and deployment challenges in real-world environments. Like Sutton's "The Bitter Lesson" revealed fundamental truths about AI research, these field notes explore what actually works when building LLM-based agents. For ML engineers and AI builders.

## Why "Bitter Lessons"?

In 2019, Richard Sutton published ["The Bitter Lesson,"](http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html) a short but profound essay that shook the AI research community. His central thesis was humbling: **the biggest breakthroughs in AI came not from cleverly encoding human knowledge, but from leveraging computation and learning at scale.**

Sutton's lesson was "bitter" because it challenged researchers to abandon what felt intellectually satisfying—elegant hand-crafted features, carefully designed representations, domain expertise encoded into systems. Instead, history showed that general methods that scale with computation (search, learning) always won in the long run.

## My Own Bitter Lessons

Building agentic AI systems has taught me my own version of this bitter truth. Time and again, I've discovered that:

- **Simple prompts with iteration beat clever prompt engineering**
- **More examples matter more than sophisticated few-shot strategies**
- **Letting the model reason in its own way works better than forcing structured thinking**
- **Tool use patterns emerge from clear interfaces, not complex orchestration**
- **Robust retry logic beats perfect first-try optimization**

These lessons are "bitter" because they often contradict my initial instincts as an engineer. I want to design elegant architectures, craft perfect prompts, build sophisticated control flows. But reality keeps teaching me that:

- **Simplicity scales better than cleverness**
- **Emergence beats engineering** (when you have the right foundation)
- **Compute and data still win** (even in the LLM era)

## What You'll Find Here

This blog documents the gaps between theory and practice, between what sounds good in research papers and what actually ships in production. You'll find:

- **Architecture patterns** that survived real-world usage
- **Failure modes** I wish someone had warned me about
- **Design decisions** I'd make differently now
- **Counterintuitive insights** that only emerged after deployment
- **Trade-offs** between elegance and reliability

I write for builders who are:
- Developing LLM-based autonomous systems
- Struggling with tool use, planning, or multi-step reasoning
- Trying to move from prototype to production
- Learning that agentic AI is harder than it looks

## The Spirit of Learning

Like Sutton's essay, this blog is about intellectual humility. Every "bitter lesson" represents a moment where reality proved my assumptions wrong. I share these not as definitive answers, but as data points from the frontier—hoping they help you avoid some of the mistakes I made, or at least fail faster and learn quicker.

If you're building agents, you'll develop your own bitter lessons. I hope reading mine makes yours a bit less painful.
