## About This Blog "Bitter Lessons in Agentic AI"
### A Builder's Journey from the Trenches

Hard-won lessons from building production agentic AI systems. This blog shares practical insights on tool use, multi-step reasoning, error recovery, and architectural patterns for autonomous AI agents. Topics span prompt engineering, system design, and deployment challenges in real-world environments. Like Sutton's "The Bitter Lesson" revealed fundamental truths about AI research, these field notes explore what actually works when building LLM-based agents. For ML engineers and AI builders.

## Why "Bitter Lessons"?

In 2019, Richard Sutton published "The Bitter Lesson", a short but profound essay that shook the AI research community. His central thesis was humbling: **the biggest breakthroughs in AI came not from cleverly encoding human knowledge, but from leveraging computation and learning at scale.**

Sutton's lesson was "bitter" because it challenged researchers to abandon what felt intellectually satisfying—elegant hand-crafted features, carefully designed representations, domain expertise encoded into systems. Instead, history showed that general methods that scale with computation (search, learning) always won in the long run.

## My Own Bitter Lessons

Building agentic AI systems has taught me my own version of this bitter truth. Time and again, I've discovered that:

- **Simple prompts with iteration beat clever prompt engineering**
- **More examples matter more than sophisticated few-shot strategies**
- **Letting the model reason in its own way works better than forcing structured thinking**
- **Tool use patterns emerge from clear interfaces, not complex orchestration**
- **Robust retry logic beats perfect first-try optimization**

These lessons are "bitter" because they often contradict my initial instincts as an engineer. I want to design elegant architectures, craft perfect prompts, build sophisticated control flows. But reality keeps teaching me that:

- **Simplicity scales better than cleverness**
- **Emergence beats engineering** (when you have the right foundation)
- **Compute and data still win** (even in the LLM era)

## What You'll Find Here

This blog documents the gaps between theory and practice, between what sounds good in research papers and what actually ships in production. You'll find:

- **Architecture patterns** that survived real-world usage
- **Failure modes** I wish someone had warned me about
- **Design decisions** I'd make differently now
- **Counterintuitive insights** that only emerged after deployment
- **Trade-offs** between elegance and reliability

I write for builders who are:
- Developing LLM-based autonomous systems
- Struggling with tool use, planning, or multi-step reasoning
- Trying to move from prototype to production
- Learning that agentic AI is harder than it looks

## The Spirit of Learning

Like Sutton's essay, this blog is about intellectual humility. Every "bitter lesson" represents a moment where reality proved my assumptions wrong. I share these not as definitive answers, but as data points from the frontier—hoping they help you avoid some of the mistakes I made, or at least fail faster and learn quicker.

If you're building agents, you'll develop your own bitter lessons. I hope reading mine makes yours a bit less painful.

## About the Author

With two decades of software engineering experience and a decade specializing in ML/AI development, I've witnessed the evolution of artificial intelligence from academic curiosity to production reality. Currently, I'm building agentic AI systems for the telecommunications vertical—where reliability, scale, and real-world constraints aren't optional.

My journey spans traditional software architecture, machine learning pipelines, and now the emerging frontier of autonomous AI agents. The lessons shared here come from production deployments, failed experiments, and the hard-earned wisdom of shipping AI systems that actually work in the field. In telecom, where systems must handle millions of transactions with minimal downtime, I've learned that elegant theories meet their match in operational reality.

This blog is my way of paying forward the knowledge I wish I had when I started building agentic systems—unfiltered insights from someone still learning, still failing, and still fascinated by what's possible when AI agents meet real-world complexity.
